			<h2>Instructions</h2>
			<ol>
				<li>Preheat the oven to 350&deg;F (180&deg;C). Grease two 9-inch round cake pans and line the bottoms with parchment paper.</li>
				<li>In a medium bowl, whisk together flour, baking powder, and salt. Set aside.</li>
				<li>In a large mixing bowl, use an electric mixer to beat the butter until creamy. Gradually add sugar and beat until light and fluffy.</li>
				<li>Beat in the eggs one at a time, followed by the vanilla extract.</li>
				<li>With the mixer on low speed, gradually add the flour mixture to the wet ingredients in three parts, alternating with the milk, beginning and ending with the flour mixture. Beat just until combined.</li>
				<li>Divide the batter evenly between the prepared pans and smooth the tops.</li>
				<li>Bake for 30â€“35 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Let cool in the pans for 10 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
				<li>For the frosting, beat the butter until creamy. Gradually add powdered sugar and beat until smooth. Add vanilla extract and mix well.</li>
				<li>Once the cakes are completely cool, place one layer on a serving plate and spread frosting on top. Place the second layer on top and frost the entire cake.</li>
